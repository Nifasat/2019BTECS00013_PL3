            <h2>Intelligence emerging from random polymer networks</h2>
            <p>A team of researchers assembled a sulfonated polyaniline (SPAN) organic electrochemical network device (OEND) for use in reservoir computing. SPAN was deposited on gold electrodes which formed a disordered network providing humidity-dependent electrical properties. The SPAN OEND was tested for reservoir computing using benchmark tasks and spoken-digit classification, which showed 70% accuracy. The device has the potential to be applied to a wide range of artificial intelligence tasks including speech recognition.</p>

            <h2>A robot that finds lost items</h2>
            <p>Researchers at MIT have created a robotic system that can do just that. The system, RFusion, is a robotic arm with a camera and radio frequency (RF) antenna attached to its gripper. It fuses signals from the antenna with visual input from the camera to locate and retrieve an item, even if the item is buried under a pile and completely out of view. The RFusion prototype the researchers developed relies on RFID tags, which are cheap, battery-less tags that can be stuck to an item and reflect signals sent by an antenna. Because RF signals can travel through most surfaces (like the mound of dirty laundry that may be obscuring the keys), RFusion is able to locate a tagged item within a pile.</p>

            <h2>Foundational step shows quantum computers can be better than the sum of their parts</h2>
            <p>Researchers have experimentally demonstrated, for the first time, that an assembly of quantum computing pieces -- a logical qubit -- can be better than the worst parts used to make it. The team shared how they took this landmark step toward reliable, practical quantum computers by implementing the Bacon-Shor code and a fault-tolerant design on an ion trap-based quantum computer.</p>
